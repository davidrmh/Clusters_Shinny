# Create your cluster dataset

This is a simple shinny app for creating custom datasets that
can be used for clustering and binary classification tasks.

You only need a default installation of shinny (included with Rstudio).

Any comments are welcome :-)


There is also a javascript version of this app, This version is friendlier.
